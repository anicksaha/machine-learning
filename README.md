## Machine-Learning   [![place_holder_text](resources/awesome.svg)](https://github.com/anicksaha/machine-learning)


This repository contains links to resources (papers, ebooks, blog posts, and courses) that I have found useful over the years to learn about NLP and ML. 

It is almost impossible to keep updating the list of papers as there are many out there already and tons of them being added daily to [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.CL/recent). 

> Note: This is a WIP and will be updated on a regular basis but with an unknown periodicty.
